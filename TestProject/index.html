<h2>Development</h2>
<div>
    <p>The project was first in development in January 2012, with Mexican director Gerardo Naranjo set to direct a script by J. Mills Goodloe.[8] In August 2012, Scott Frank was hired to re-write the script.[9] In November 2014, Hany Abu-Assad replaced Naranjo,[10] and Chris Weitz was later hired to re-write the script.[11]</p>

       <p> Abu-Assad has said of the film, "I really didn’t see an epic love story against the background of survival, I think optimism and hope is crucial to survive. And to go on with your life even if you’ve had a lot of bad luck. So if you give (in) to the bad luck, you will die. (But) if you fight the bad luck, you have a better chance to survive and make your life better. This is very simple wisdom, yes? But still very crucial especially in these kind of days, when everybody feels entitled to their good luck."[12]</p>

<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>The film went through several lead casting changes. In March 2012, it was announced that Michael Fassbender would star as Bass,[13] but by September 2014, Fassbender dropped out due to a scheduling conflict, and Charlie Hunnam replaced him. Margot Robbie also came on board to star as Alex.[14] In November 2014, Robbie dropped out of the project, and Rosamund Pike entered negotiations for the lead role.[10] In December 2015, both Hunnam and Pike dropped out.[11]</p>
<p>In February 2016, Idris Elba came on board,[15] followed by Kate Winslet in June 2016.[16] Dermot Mulroney joined the cast as Winslet's character's fiancé in early February 2017.[17]</p>

<h2>Filming</h2>
<p>Principal photography started on December 5, 2016, in Vancouver, and continued until February 24, 2017.[18] Elba and Winslet filmed scenes at the Vancouver International Airport and Abbotsford International Airport on December 7, 2016.[19] Filming stopped for Christmas holidays, from December 20, 2016 to January 3, 2017.[20]</p>
<p>
    Filming resumed around Invermere and Panorama Mountain Village on January 4, 2017.[21]

    Most of the filming took place in Canada, on the border of Alberta and British Columbia. Abu-Assad has described the locations as having very cold temperatures, and tough and harsh filming conditions. Many scenes were shot on a mountaintop, and he and the crew had to drive 40 minutes before reaching the film's base camp. When the weather was okay, they could board the helicopter to reach their destination along with their supplies.[12]

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>
        German-Iranian composer Ramin Djawadi composed & conducted the music for the film.[22] The official trailer for the movie was released with "Dusk Till Dawn" by Zayn Malik and Sia as the soundtrack. The score from the film is now released at Lakeshore Records. Soundtrackdreams reviewed, 'The main theme from “The mountain between us” is the best advertisement for this score; a sweeping piano and violin theme, both grandiose and intimate at the same time, a proper dramatic opening that gets emotional from the first minutes without an adjustment period. The first cue is the kind of piece that could have very well sat at the end as the dramatic climax of the movie. The horn buildup towards the end joins the rolling piano in making sure this theme will end up as one of the most memorable he has ever written.'[23]
